	2. cobaya (pip)
	3. getdist (pip)

- - -

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
use_python("/anaconda2/bin/python")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown documents allows including R-code syntax and plain text (Markdown formatting syntax) which later can be exported to HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Running cobaya on RStudio

Cobaya (a code for Bayesian analysis in Cosmology) is a full-written python framework for sampling and statistical modelling in Cosmology. To run cobaya, it is needed to include python-code block in RMarkdown:

```{python, include=TRUE}
from cobaya.run import run
import numpy as np
from collections import OrderedDict as odict

info = {"output": "chains/gaussian",
    "likelihood": {
        "gaussian": {
            "mean": [0.2, 0],
            "cov": [[0.1, 0.05],
                    [0.05,0.2]]}},
    "params": odict([
        ("a", {
            "prior": {"min": -0.5, "max": 3},
            "latex": r"\alpha"}),
        ("b", {
            "prior": {"dist": "norm", "loc": 0, "scale": 1},
            "ref": 0,
            "proposal": 0.5,
            "latex": r"\beta"}),
        ("derived_a", {
            "latex": r"\alpha^\prime"}),
        ("derived_b", {
            "latex": r"\beta^\prime"})]),
    "sampler": {
        "mcmc": None}}

updated_info, products = run(info)

# Export the results to GetDist
from getdist.mcsamples import loadCobayaSamples
#print updated_info
#print products["sample"]
gd_sample = loadCobayaSamples(info, products["sample"])
# Analyze and plot
import getdist.plots as gdplt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Mean:")
print(gd_sample.getMeans()[:2])
print("Covariace matrix:")
print(gd_sample.getCovMat().matrix[:2,:2])
# %matplotlib inline  # uncomment if running from the Jupyter notebook
import getdist.plots as gdplot
gdplot = gdplt.getSubplotPlotter()
gdplot.triangle_plot(gd_sample, ["a", "b"], filled=True)
plt.show()
```
